## Project Description

Our project will be a blog/facebook project. The user will start at the home page where they can either sign-up or log-in. The sign-up page will ask for an email and password, maybe even use a 3rd party app to authenticate like Google or Facebook. Once logged in the user can edit their profile which includes a picture, bio, and other features. The user can then post a blog with a title and content. The post is saved as a draft until the user publishes their post. Once published, the post is added to the feed. The feed will contain chronological posts from all users on our project. All users on the website can comment on their posts or other posts as well. The user can also edit their posts or comments or unpublish their posts. Finally, the user can delete their specific post, or delete their account in general.

## Design and Technology

We will be using the Model-View-Controller project architecture. We are also sticking to JavaScript as our main programming language. We might consider using a frontend framework to send API requests like Vue, React, or Angular. The view will send requests to the controller or backend. The backend server will receive HTTP requests and modify the database using the database model. We will be using a nosql database.
